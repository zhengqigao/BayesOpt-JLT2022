# BayesOpt-JLT2022

This repo contains code for our paper titled 'Automatic Synthesis of Broadband Silicon Photonic Devices via Bayesian Optimization' submitted to IEEE Journal of Lightwave Technology (IEEE JLT).

If you are looking for a bare-bone implementation of Bayesian optimization. Please see the folder SimpleBO. If you are interested in reproducing results of our paper, please see the folder Directional-Coupler, Y-Splitter, and Ring-Resonator.

The code will be available once our paper is accepted.
