Run the command: `python simplebo.py` to reproduce the log file shown in log.txt. It is possible that you obtain slightly different result due to the version of Python packages and the pseudo random seeds. 

Moreover, it is possible to see warnings when you run the code like `ABNORMAL_TERMINATION_IN_LNSRCH`. Please consider adjusting the kernel and the data normalization method. However, personally, I find that even with this warning, the overall Bayesian optimization still yields sufficiently good performance.
